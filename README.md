### Note ###
1. Also, if the need arises, we could use pagination on top of the existing responsive page in case of more categories, and/or more textual information. 
   This could be done by using an API to get data from the server, thus allowing us to limit the number/size of the response.

2. Depending on the relation between the categories of text, we could group them first, and then show different categories in the each group. 
   We could try different Tabs for different Groups or Use a similar Tree View with the group headings as the first level of nodes, so to speak.
